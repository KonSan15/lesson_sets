# Introduction to Circular Motion

When an object moves in a circular path, it experiences a centripetal acceleration directed toward the center of the circle.

:::continue

## Basic Concepts
The magnitude of centripetal acceleration is given by:

$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$

where $v$ is the velocity and $r$ is the radius of the circle.

:::question multiple-choice
Which way does centripetal acceleration point?

A) Away from the center
B) Toward the center
C) Tangent to the circle
D) In the direction of motion

correct: B
explanation: Centripetal acceleration must point toward the center to keep the object in circular motion.
hint: Think about what force is needed to keep an object moving in a circle
