These can be:\n- Hormones (like insulin or adrenaline)\n- Growth factors (like EGF - Epidermal Growth Factor)\n- Neurotransmitters (like acetylcholine)\n- Cytokines (like interleukins)\n\nEach signal molecule has a specific shape that fits into a complementary receptor, much like a key fitting into a lock. This specificity ensures that cells only respond to relevant signals."

This is particularly important for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are common in many signaling pathways.\n\nThe binding process typically involves:\n1. Signal molecule attachment to the receptor's external domain\n2. Receptor dimerization (two receptors coming together)\n3. Activation of the receptor's internal kinase domain\n4. Auto-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues"

Adapter proteins recognize the phosphorylated receptor\n2. These adapters recruit the first kinase (often Ras-GEF)\n3. This activates Ras (a G-protein)\n4. Ras activates RAF (MAPKKK)\n5. RAF phosphorylates MEK (MAPKK)\n6. MEK phosphorylates ERK (MAPK)\n\nEach step in this cascade serves to both transmit and amplify the signal. One activated receptor can lead to the activation of many downstream proteins, creating a significant cellular response from a relatively small initial signal."

Negative feedback loops\n\nThese regulatory mechanisms ensure that signals are appropriate in both strength and duration."
